# Summary
In my passion project I always try writing tidy code and prefer efficient solutions over fast-to-implement ones.
I am a fan of optimization(memory optimization exceptionally) and current situation(when simple and often trivial apps take up an unreasonable amount of memory) irritates me viciously, so I am always on the lookout for ways of optimization. As a junior developer, I highly value any possibility to acquire new skills that may benefit me development-vise.   
#  Skills  
My programming background is represented mainly by 2 languages I love: Java and Haskell, that is besides any auxiliary languages like basic SQL for database management(that one I've picked up quite recently). About a year ago I've started making applications for Android. My current Android skills include: simple GUI made out of built-in GUI elements, basic style usage and a basic knowledge of Layouts. I understand basic OOP principles and currently studying software design patterns as I want to improve the structure of my projects. For a year I've been actively using Haskell and worked on various projects with a friend of mine, so I understand main principles of Functional Programming and enjoy it greatly.
# Code samples
Coming soon, as I am a little ashamed of the code I've written. Especially my attempt at "Awful code" competition.
# Experience
As far as a real workflow experience - I don't have any. The only things I've written are pet-projects.
